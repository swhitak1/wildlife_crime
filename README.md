# Wildlife Crime Spatial Analysis: Chesapeake Bay Region

### Overview
This project visualizes and analyzes spatial patterns of wildlife crime across the Chesapeake Bay watershed using ArcGIS Pro and ArcGIS StoryMaps. The goal is to identify poaching hotspots, link environmental factors to crime incidence, and create an interactive tool for conservation outreach.

### Research Significance
Wildlife crime is a major driver of biodiversity loss worldwide and has direct impacts on ecosystem health. Mapping patterns of poaching and illegal trade provides spatial context for law enforcement and conservation agencies to prioritize resources and protect vulnerable species.

### My Role
- Collected and georeferenced regional wildlife crime data.  
- Designed and styled all interactive maps in ArcGIS Pro and ArcGIS Online.  
- Created a public-facing StoryMap to communicate findings to conservation stakeholders.
